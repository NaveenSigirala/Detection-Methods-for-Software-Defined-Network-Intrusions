# Detection-Methods-for-Software-Defined-Network-Intrusions
Developed an Intrusion Detection System for Software Defined Networks using Decision Trees and Genetic Algorithms to
effectively detect and classify network threats. The model was trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, with PCA applied for
feature selection to enhance accuracy and reduce dimensionality. It successfully identified intrusion types such as DoS
and Probe attacks while maintaining a low false positive rate. A real-time GUI was implemented for data input, result
visualization, and log generation. This project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning, data preprocessing, and
cybersecurity for building intelligent and practical network defense systems.
